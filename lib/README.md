# Libraries
This is the directory that contains all necessary libs.
Most of them you can download via `git submodule update --init` from the root of the repo.

**Note** that algine absent in git submodules list! You must download source code manually.
Folder for engine source code: `algine`
<br>This is done to facilitate synchronization and development of both examples and the engine.
If you already have the engine source code, just create **symlink** on it.
